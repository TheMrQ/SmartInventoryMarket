Project: Smart Inventory Market

Thesis: Development of an Intelligent Supermarket Inventory Management and Product Demand Forecasting System Using Machine Learning

Overall status: `IN_PROGRESS` — P8 LightGBM Forecasting

## Quick Human Summary

What we decided:

- M5 `CA_1` food products are the official forecasting scope: 1,437 SKU-level series.
- The official forecast is 28 daily steps; the app will derive 7/14/28-day demand summaries from it.
- Train, validation, and test are frozen chronological windows; the test window is held out.
- The 28-day Moving Average is the current validation reference baseline.
- The first ML formulation is a global one-step model with recursive 28-day forecasting.
- Inventory will be simulated transparently because M5 has no real inventory history.
- MySQL is the application database; MySQL Workbench is its design/admin tool.
- Historical sales can first be imported by CSV; a real deployment should later sync new sales from POS automatically.

Why:

- FOODS is closest to the supermarket scenario, and audited `CA_1` FOODS has the lowest zero-sales prevalence among the candidate full-FOODS stores.
- 1,437 series are large enough for global ML experiments while remaining manageable.
- A 28-day forecast aligns with M5 and supports both short- and medium-term inventory views.
- Mixing unrelated sales and inventory datasets would weaken the thesis.
- A deployed supermarket must eventually use its own POS history, not Walmart M5 data permanently.

What we did:

- Downloaded and locally inspected the five official M5 files.
- Verified their real columns, sizes, products, stores, dates, sales, and prices.
- Froze `CA_1` + `FOODS`, all three FOODS departments, a 28-day horizon, and chronological evaluation boundaries.
- Added the version-controlled protocol at `configs/data/m5_ca1_foods.yaml`.
- Prepared the frozen source boundary and generated the first fixed-origin 28-day validation forecasts.
- Converted train sales into leakage-safe ML features: past sales lags, rolling demand, calendar/events, product codes, and historical prices.

What we learned:

- `CA_1` + `FOODS` contains exactly 1,437 item-store series across `FOODS_1`, `FOODS_2`, and `FOODS_3`.
- The frozen 28-day windows are train `d_1`–`d_1885`, validation `d_1886`–`d_1913`, and test `d_1914`–`d_1941`.
- No observed M5 zero sale proves zero demand or zero inventory.
- On validation, the 28-day Moving Average outperformed Seasonal Naive: MAE 1.438625 vs 1.739785, RMSE 2.726401 vs 3.357394, and WAPE 68.366443% vs 82.678226%.
- The 28 validation days contained 81 SKUs with zero total actual sales, so their per-SKU WAPE is undefined rather than treated as zero.
- FEATURE_SET_V1 contains 25 model features across 2,668,509 train rows; tests confirm features cannot see their own target or future sales.

What happens next: train the first global LightGBM model, generate a recursive 28-day validation forecast, and compare it with the frozen baselines. No ML model has been trained yet.

## Current Task

P7 is complete. FEATURE_SET_V1 creates the train-only long-form matrix and supports later recursive single-step inference using explicit history. It includes leakage-safe lag/rolling demand, known calendar/event, product identity, and past-only price features. No model has been trained, no ML validation predictions exist, and TEST remains sealed.

## Last Stable Checkpoint

`CHECKPOINT-007` — Leakage-safe FEATURE_SET_V1 complete

## Next Exact Step

`NEXT-008` — Train the first LightGBM global forecasting model, generate the 28-day recursive validation forecast, and compare it with the frozen baselines.

NEXT-008 must preserve the frozen scope/split and test isolation. It may train/evaluate on validation, but must not evaluate TEST.

## Known Blockers

None.
